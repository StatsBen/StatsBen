    <h1>benjamindavidclark.com Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      No users other than myself will be granted an account to this website.
      Don't try to log in, nothing will happen (except that I'll be able to see
      that you've tried). The only reason I've even implemented a log in at all
      is so that I can manage my own website remotely. There shall be no other
      users besides myself, and I will store no data on any other users, except
      in the event in which they attempt to log in, in which case all that will
      be stored is whatever random crap Google decides to collect (because
      they're running the sign-in service).
